## <a href="https://adityamamta.github.io/faq-accordion/"><img src="img/readme-btn.png" alt="Click to view live website" height="120"></a>

This project is a clean and interactive FAQ section built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each question in the FAQ can be expanded to reveal an answer, with smooth animations and icon toggling for better user experience.

# Features
- Accordion-Style FAQ: Only one question can be expanded at a time, maintaining a compact and user-friendly layout.
- Icon Toggle: Uses two icons (e.g., add and remove icons) that dynamically switch based on the question's state (expanded/collapsed).
- Responsive Design: Styled with CSS to ensure a seamless display across devices.
- Smooth Transitions: Animations make expanding and collapsing answers feel smooth and engaging.
# Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with SCSS for organized styling)
- JavaScript (for toggling answers and icons)
